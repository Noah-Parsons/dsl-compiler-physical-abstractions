# DSL Compiler for Physical Abstractions

This repository contains an early-stage implementation of a domain-specific language (DSL) compiler designed for the formal representation and transformation of physical systems. It integrates symbolic parsing, dimensional type checking, and category-theoretic abstraction to model physical quantities, laws, and symmetries.

## Overview

The compiler parses LaTeX-inspired DSL syntax into an abstract syntax tree (AST), applies physical unit consistency checks, and compiles the result into an intermediate representation (IR) grounded in category theory. This IR captures physical quantities as objects and physical laws as morphisms, enabling symbolic reasoning and future integration with numerical solvers and formal verification tools.

## Features

- **Custom DSL Syntax**  
  Support for LaTeX-style commands (`\defvar`, `\define`, `\boundary`, `\symmetry`) to define variables, equations, and symmetries.

- **Lexer and Parser**  
  Recursive-descent parser with full expression support including operator precedence and parenthetical grouping.

- **Dimensional Type System**  
  Static type checker with unit inference and dimensional analysis to ensure physical consistency.

- **Categorical Intermediate Representation**  
  Encodes physical structures using category-theoretic constructs (objects, morphisms, identity, composition), enabling formal reasoning.

- **Extensible Architecture**  
  Designed for future phases including differential operator support, symbolic simulation, theorem proving, and code generation.
